# Fusion: Arc-Halo Cognitive Fusion Reactor Core

This module implements the cognitive fusion reactor that integrates Deep Tree Echo state networks with Yggdrasil decision forests, creating a self-aware cognitive system with persistent identity and meta-learning capabilities.

## Key Components

-   `ArcHaloFusionCore`: The main class for the fusion core implementation.
-   `SelfModel`: Represents the system's understanding of itself.
-   `MetaLearningEngine`: Enables the system to learn and improve its own cognitive strategies.
-   `IdentityAtom`: Dataclass for representing aspects of identity.
-   `CognitiveState`: Dataclass for representing the current cognitive state.

## Functionality

-   Integrating information from all membranes to form a coherent cognitive state.
-   Maintaining a persistent self-model and identity.
-   Performing meta-cognitive monitoring and system adaptation.
-   Optimizing cognitive strategies using meta-learning.
-   Processing queries with self-awareness context.
-   Saving and loading the fusion core state.
